## About this project

Kenna is a visual editor tool that leverages machine learning technology to help game developers author high fidelity, utility based, Artificial Intelligent agents.

A developer can use Kenna’s visual tool to setup scenarios for candidate AIs. The candidates will then undergo machine learning until satisfactory results are met according to the scenario parameters. The learned model is then converted to a utility framework to incorporate in the candidates’ decision-making process.
